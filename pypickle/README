This directory contains code for changeing some of the simulation output I have in to more
convenient python pickle files. 

Got to have a working PyROOT installation code inspired by A. Anderson and D. Barker's code(s)

Easiest way is to use D'Ann's sourcing procedure:

module load matlab/2015a
# anaconda for python
module use /local/gammasoft/modules
module load anaconda2-module
alias startpy='source activate barker'
alias endpy='source deactivate

Or, see pg 56 of N-MISC-17-003

$module use /local/gammasoft/modules
$module load anaconda2-module
$source activate barker

Invocation on command line is like:

$python convertCapSim_pickle.py /data/chocula/villaa/cascadeSimData/normge_fast_test.pkl /data/chocula/villaa/cascadeSimData/normge_fast.root

first file is file to write, second (and third, fourth, fifth, etc) are files to read and chain together.
