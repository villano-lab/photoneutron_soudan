This directory contains code for changeing some of the simulation output I have in to more
convenient python pickle files. 

Got to have a working PyROOT installation code inspired by A. Anderson and D. Barker's code(s)

Easiest way is to use D'Ann's sourcing procedure:

module load matlab/2015a
# anaconda for python
module use /local/gammasoft/modules
module load anaconda2-module
alias startpy='source activate barker'
alias endpy='source deactivate
